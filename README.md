Blackjack Game
A simple and fun Blackjack game written in Python. This project is created by Aaryan Gupta, a learning coder, to practice programming concepts such as functions, conditionals, loops, and basic game logic.

How to Play
The game follows the basic rules of Blackjack:

The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.
Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points.
If you get 21 with your first two cards (an Ace and a 10-point card), you have a Blackjack.
The player and the computer (dealer) each start with two cards. The player can see both their cards and one of the dealer's cards.

The player can choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (end their turn). The player can draw cards until they either stand or go over 21.

The dealer will draw cards until their total is 17 or higher.

The player wins if their total is higher than the dealer's total without exceeding 21. A Blackjack (21 with the first two cards) beats any other 21 total.
